<h3 align="center">School Project for object detection AI</h3>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is our student group project for our second year, Fall 2025 for LAB University. The aim of this project is to create a working object detection AI, learn how to make a Image detection AI and how to work one. Where once given a photogrammeric map of an area, the OB will be capable of recognizing harmful vegatation within the area, with possible heatmap detection capabilities.

The project will hopefully be of use when comparing water areas and effects human impact has on them vegetation wise.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

As our project is a student project with primary goal of learning how to make this all a working project, it will be mostly about getting started. WebODM and Label-Studio will both however have working tutorials contained within the repository.

### Prerequisites

* YOLOv8
* WebODM
* Label-Studio
* Basic knowledge of how python works

### Programs and APIs used

1. YOLOv8 and Ultralytics
2. Python
3. Docker
4. Git
5. Albumentation


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

We will add working examples of the project at a later date. Currently we have been purely on survival mode to get this all working.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Finish training AI
- [ ] Heatmap prototype
- [ ] Implement Albumentation into dataset creation process
- [ ] Remake datasets to be in line with pretraining data
- [ ] Rework the readme
- [ ] Implement UI
