### Currently we are doing preliminary research on how the programs used by East Uudenmaan and Provoo River water and air protection association work and gathering knowledge on planst and invasive species of vegetation on Finnish waterways. We plan to have an working AI, demo or a prototype that can detect invasive species.

19.09.2025 - I've found datasets of vegetations photo that could show us in what directions we can aim, plus some possibly are going to be used for training. So far finding datasets that would fit in our expectation is quiet hard (drone photos of water areas with somehow tagged vegetation) if we would have access to the photos taken for the east-usima project and taging them with some external help would be very beneficial. 
19.09.2025 - At this moment selected two pretrained models for this project APNet-YOLOv8s and DenseNet201 first one is better suited for local AI as its more recourse efficient but the latter is more precise and have more space and potencial for other feuters and even more precision with cost of high computing power required which exteend the time of excecution significatly enough to make it not optimal for local aplicaton and centralized aproche is recommended.
