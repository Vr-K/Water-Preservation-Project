The last two weeks ended up being a time off from the project. Nothing much was done on AI and dataset side of things. Aka Veera and Jakub.

Veera will continue with datasets and labeling. It is just slow going.

Jakub will continue with AI trouble shooting to get some working.

Prashant looked up into some heatmaps, current suggestions are between Grad-CAM and YOLOv8 natives. Split the work, so Prashant will look more into Grad-CAM heatmapping and Veera will look into YOLO native heatmapping. Will compare at the next friday.

Mamata working on UX for the project. We are unsure if we will be in a place where we can implement said UI by 12th, but it will be there. Mamata will read up on how to make datasets and hopefully be able to help with labeling.

Imo lot of things are coming together, but slowly. Currently just being swamped by other school work so Water Protection Association project is just taking a backseat. Bottlenecked by the datasets, simple but monotonous work that takes a long while.
