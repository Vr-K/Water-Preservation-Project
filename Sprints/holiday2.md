12.12.2025-09.01.2026 review

The mentioned time was the Finnish Yule holidays so Veera and Mamata mostly took it easy and tried to do some prelim research on how to progress and work on existing things. They had three seperate catch up sessions during this time, updates and such.

First one was 16.12. This was mostly figuring out what had been done, and trying to order things for the future. Mamata was going to look into how the heatmap Prashant left would work and albumentation. Veera would be the contact point  on like if the two would be able to access higher education super computer for training the AI, Jakub about his documentation, people working with the Association and reading up on YOLO docs and how to work the AI and it's training.

Second catch up was on 27.12. Everyone seems to have been on holidays so Veera had not heard from anyone in Puhti/Mahti/LUMI or Jakub. Other contacts did not seem important. They did come across SAM2, another update to the dataset generation process(sigh), where simply using boxes and SAM2 AI we would be able to generate datasets more accurately and faster. They will look more into that while waiting. They also have the YOLO training process down, so the two are now able to continue where they left off.

Mamata managed to work out several image datasets using albumentation so we have that working as well. Prashant heatmap set up did not work, so Mamata will have to look up how to work it in YOLOv8. There were however some existing info from the ultralytics AI answers regarding YOLO8 saved on github, so at least she has a starting point.

Final catch up was on 08.01.2026

Veera ended up getting the SAM2 working, and testing, can showcase how it works, but not much else. Also had the realization that we simply do not have the image data regarding the vegetation itself to create datasets from for the AI to train on. This is on me(Veera) for tunnel visioning on getting a working AI and not realizing we would not be getting a working product out of the data that the client has given us. Hope they don't get mad.

Mamata got the heatmap working for YOLOv8 and has some working examples for cars and roads.

Either way things are both good and bad. Just like in the fall. Small progress that is not visible to anyone outside the project. Now wondering if it is ok to keep on improving the pipeline so making an "physical app" computer vision AI for client might want (from creating datasets to fully functioning AI with GUI) would only take a week or so, or if it would be better to cut the losses. Either way Veera will talk with Mira on 09.01.2026 about the future of project again. Also cause the old Association contact has retired from the project.
