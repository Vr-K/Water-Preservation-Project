Veera and Mamata will be continuing the project through the holidays and into the next year. Jakub and Prashant are moving onto other things.

For now Veera and Mamata will be refamiliarizing themselves with the project and what it requires, as well as contacting people who might be able to help with speeding up the training process. Veera will be the contact person and trying to get the AI working based on what Jakub has left behind and Mamata will focus on heatmap and the albumentation.

Restructuring and clearing up and studying up and implementing. Lot of little things that should have been done earlier but we didnt have time due to end of semester being a mess.
