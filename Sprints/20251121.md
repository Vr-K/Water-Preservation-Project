Mamata was sick this week, so unable to attend class. She will be reading up on ultralytics in prep for spring(?), it's hard for her to do anything specific other than weekly gruntwork, which I also keep giving her since she came in late and i kept giving her the work i kept pushing off for later. And now there's nothing really to do?

Mamata needs to push her stuff to github. Jakub AI files are present, now I can start reading through those.

AI still training, will show to Mira when this iteration is done later in class.

I guess I will be pushing WebODM and label-studio ref to github if already not there? This week will be upkeep for me I suppouse. Need to clean up repo and update things as well. Namely the readme on main.

Prashant will make a demo for heatmap so he has something he has finished for the course. Simple use of some random image and a random AI, should suffice that his heatmap example will work. We also do have access to the datasets, AI and

We need to consider the presentation now. The showcase is on December 5th. What can we show? What do we have? Will start on presentation, Jakub and Prashant working on demos.

- What we are currently doing
- Things that are slowing us down right now

Visualize what we have in mind, what we have done.
