~~Jakub and~~ Mamata have forgotten to push their stuff on github again, which is an issue. Can't confirm one way or another how anything works or to look up. Scratch Jakub not having pushed things, I simply missed it. Now I can get to looking through the files and getting a better idea on how the AI works

We need to consider the presentation now. The showcase is on December 5th. What can we show?

Outline:
- Summary
- What we have planned
- What we are currently doing
- Things that are slowing us down right now

Visualize what we have in mind. Work in canva? Canva is good enough, I think?
