ok so jakub working on ai. using existing datasets to pretrain the ai. will use our existing dataset with the WRONG TYPE OF DATASET because i am an idiot. but it's fine, i will remake it in segmentation format instead.

i finally understood what the segmentation means, which means me remaking the dataset again :) yey team.

mamata will be working on the water AI subset. namely will only be looking for water lilies and common reeds, she will be working on more if she finishes.
