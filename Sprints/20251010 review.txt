Sprint review 10.10.2025

Both Prashant and Mamata were reported sick for the day. This means Prashant has only been present for 2 classes/meetings this semester.

Teacher suggested they form a seperate team by themselves, which would make it easier for them to make something for the semester instead of catching up on the existing data that has been done.

What will be done with the team composition, will be decided on following friday.

Jakub is almoust finished with combining Svin Transformer and YOLOv8 into one pipeline, but keeps facing bugs that prevent us from testing it.

Veera finished the dataset tutorial only on thursday and knows how to make working datasets that work with both YOLOv8 And Svin. Aka COCO. They will contact Kimmo about help with recognizing plants through email and making an actually useable dataset from the images we were given. They also said they would start looking into using the photogrammery maps and creating heatmaps from those, but that might be 17.10th onward kind of deal.

Implemented Kanban-board into the project, in case Prashant or Mamata do end up continuing with the project. This way everyone will have a visible and clear idea on what they have done and will try and do.
