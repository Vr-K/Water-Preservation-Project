05.12.2025 Report

Today's meeting was a mess. We were suppoused to present our project for the end of the year to the client, but it feels like everything went wrong.

Prashant finally submitted what he had been working on in regards to heatmap only 5 minutes before the meeting was set to start to the github. Veera ended up trying to present a badly made presentation about the AI, thinking it would be enough, ended up being embarassing since it didn't really show anything about the current state of the project but an older version. Jakub showed up late to the meeting some 20 mins late and forgot to bring his computer. Mamata arrived after the meeting had ended.

After the meeting with the client Veera asked Mira about the future of the project and Mira said they would talk about it next week. The team members decided on not to do anything regarding the following week in case they would not continue it the coming semester.

Also seem to have misplaced the 28.11.2025 review files. Not that anything was lost, basically the same as sprint 21.11 one
