12.12.2025 Report

Had a semi-meeting about the future of the project. Was decided that Veera and Mamata would continue in the spring semester. Apparently clients are still interested in us continuing the project, which I am surprised about. Next meeting will held in January.

Veera and Mamata need to re-establish basically everything, like who will do what.

If there is a way to access HPC (High-Performance Computing) services? Aka contact Puhti, Mahti ja LUMI about training our AI. We can not do so on school computers. Our own computers would also take an entire day of just running the training, so that is also not possible. Veera will do this

- Check out if heatmap prashant presented works and can be used. If not need to just make a new one.

- Figure out how to train the AI in general. Veera has access to Jakub's dir so they can do that.

- The UX and how to connect existing parts into a working whole.
	- add the webodm and label studio

- Figure out how much training data we do need. Do we need to get many more datasets?

- What plants do we need to focus on? Veera has customer information, so they will be asking about those at some point
